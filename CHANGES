 - Added wait/notify* APIs to rl::atomic_flag

Jan 7, 2026
 - Added more support for GCC12, 13, and 14 with libstdc++
 - Added support for C++20's std::atomic wait/notify* APIs.
 - Relacy no longer defines memory_order_* macros to insert the rl::debug_info
   with the current file/line information. In C++20 mode, Relacy uses
   std::source_location to do this automatically without relying on macros.
   As of this release, Relacy introduces RELACY_ENABLE_MEMORY_ORDER_DEBUG_INFO_DEFAULTING
   to allow using the older behavior, which should only be needed in pre-C++20.
